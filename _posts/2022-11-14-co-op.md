According to the program website, a co-op scholar looks forward to ‚Äúthe best start possible‚Äù, ‚Äúa world of opportunities‚Äù, and ‚Äúlife changing connections‚Äù. But what does that actually mean, and if it‚Äôs so great why does everyone seem to drop out??

**Buckle up because I am about to give you the uncensored rundown of what co-op is _actually_ like.**

Please note that this is just one nerd‚Äôs experience through the UNSW Co-op Program in the Computer Science stream! Most of my experiences apply to the program as a whole, but I will note when I am discussing anything stream-specific. I also like to think that my opinions are justified but your situation is entirely your own, so all I am offering here is some perspective :)

### ok hold up, what exactly is the unsw co-op scholarship?

Read the [website](https://www.coop.unsw.edu.au/future-students) if you want the full details, but I‚Äôm going to cover the interesting bits (and the bits they don‚Äôt tell you).

Basically, if you know you want to study a degree that the UNSW Co-op Program offers a stream for, they can offer you a deal.

Maintain at least 65 out of 100 in all your courses at uni and show up at whatever random events they want you to attend (this doesn‚Äôt happen a lot), and in return you will get some very nice perks which help set you up for a career after graduation.

These perks include:

- **Guaranteed three 5-month industry placements** over the course of your degree. Work experience without having to apply!
- **Around $19.5k of untaxed income a year** which gets paid to you as a fortnightly salary (exact figure may have changed since i published this article). It‚Äôs also fun to note that the most expensive degree at UNSW costs [just over $15k a year](https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/fees/csp). You do the maths :)
- **(Almost) guaranteed graduate offers from sponsor companies.** Applying for graduate positions is definitely a stressful process, so this is a very valuable safety net.
- **Mentorship from a co-op alumni.** How well this goes requires both a bit of luck in getting a mentor with the kind of life experience + advice that you need to hear, and your own effort in staying in contact with them. But if it goes well this is extremely valuable!
- **Free leadership camp**. Thoughts on the usefulness of this camp are very mixed, but as someone who actively avoided leadership prior to the camp, I found that it gave me a chance to work on skills that I lacked and motivation to work on them further afterwards.
- **Some random career planning workshops and guides**. I only mention it because it‚Äôs brought up on the co-op website, but I honestly forgot this was a thing we did. You can definitely learn the same things at general society events.

Other unofficial perks include

- Meeting cool people through Co-op Society events and their first year camp
- Potential to earn some extra money if you sign up to be a co-op ambassador - aka go to schools and tell kids how great co-op is
- Getting bullied for no reason by non co-op students (and Aasvogel Aardvark)

In first year, I was having a great time as a co-op student! I met some amazing people at the Co-op Society First Year Camp who kept me sane during the 2020 lockdowns, and have become some of my closest friends to this day. I was very much enjoying the nice sum of money landing in my bank account every fortnight, and started investing (üíé‚úã). There really was nothing to complain about.

### so why did you drop out?

The trouble started when I actually started my first placement. At this point, the downsides of the co-op deal started to reveal themselves.

The downsides:

- **Very little control over which sponsor companies you get placed at.** Every stream does it differently but for computer science, everyone gives the co-op office their list of preferences. They then allocate aiming to give people their highest preferences. This is perfectly fine if all sponsors are relatively equally enticing to work at, but this was definitely not the case for my stream at the time. It‚Äôs pretty unlikely that your three placements will include all three of your top preferences.
- **Your range of possible experiences is limited to what the sponsor companies happen to offer.** Perhaps you want experience at a startup, or try a role that‚Äôs untraditional for your degree. If the companies that are sponsoring your stream can't offer what you want, then it is what it is.
- Going off of the last point, **not every sponsor company will have roles that you‚Äôre interested in, or will have a positive company culture**. If you get placed at one of these, it can feel you‚Äôre wasting 5 months of time working there. The co-op office likes to say that you never know until you try, and at least you get to find out what you really don‚Äôt enjoy ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- **Difficult to pursue other opportunities.** Exchange, and any other internships have to be organised around your placements. Sometimes sponsor companies are chill, but the co-op office is not so chill, so you‚Äôre always going to have to negotiate.
- **Less flexibility with course load.** Talk to a UNSW student for longer than 10 minutes and they will probably complain about trimesters. With 10 teaching weeks per trimester, it results in a lot of content being crammed into a short period of time. In a standard trimester, you take three courses. I like to fully understand what I‚Äôm learning, and I‚Äôve found this is essentially impossible to do while taking three courses at once and attempting to have time to see friends and/or have a part time job. But since co-op requires you to graduate on time, you‚Äôll have to take three courses for at least two trimesters per year.

**Let‚Äôs also do the maths.** $19.5k a year sounds GREAT. That‚Äôs $78k over four years. AMAZING. And you only really have to do 15 months worth of work.

Hang on a second. If you‚Äôre working 15 months of 38 hour weeks, that‚Äôs equal to 570 hours. So that comes to an hourly rate of uh‚Ä¶ $13.68 an hour?

What if you were to work at a restaurant/bar part time for the duration of uni? Let‚Äôs say 16 hours a week at $28 an hour. If you work 48 weeks of the year, that‚Äôs $21.5k. At the current Australian taxation rates, $3.3k would then go to tax, leaving you with $18.2k for the year.

Obviously doing co-op placements vs working in service have different pros and cons, but **from a purely financial perspective, co-op doesn‚Äôt really give you any significant advantage over a regular job.**

For me, I was starting to question whether I could see a future as a software engineer. I wanted to explore roles in data, site reliability engineering and artificial intelligence, but the chances of a) getting placed at a company that offers one of these roles and b) that company having availability in a relevant team, was lower than I would have liked.

My first placement was fine and I had a decent team, but was also a big reason why I was feeling largely uninspired. Hearing experiences from peers at the other sponsor companies, there weren‚Äôt very many that gave me much hope of having a better experience.

Inertia is a thing though, so I did spend a lot of time dragging my feet and being comfortable with being vaguely discontent. But as my first placement ended and I found myself completely uninterested in placing preferences for the next one, I knew it was time to leave.

### what happens when you drop?

When you‚Äôve made your decision, you need to break the news to the co-op office. You can go straight to email, but I felt like it was fair to do it over call. So I just sent an email to the co-op coordinator asking to chat, organised a time, and then had a conversation where I stated my decision to drop and talked about why I was making that decision.

After this very awkward conversation, they will give you the steps required to formally leave the co-op program.

This includes:

- Completing any remaining tasks
- Sending an email stating your intention to leave the co-op program
- Paying back the scholarship money you have received since the conclusion of your most recent placement (if you haven‚Äôt completed a placement yet, you‚Äôll have to pay back _all_ the money you‚Äôve received so far)
- If you send this email less than 3 months prior to when your next placement is supposed to start, you‚Äôll also have to pay an extra 6 months worth of scholarship money

### do you regret it?

No, but also maybe a little.

I absolutely do not regret starting co-op. As someone who has big dreams and is a bit of a try-hard, Co-op Society was a great way to meet many likeminded people! Meeting cool and inspiring people is frankly the most underrated part of uni, and I‚Äôd argue just as important as the actual education.

Could I have done the same thing through other societies and met individual co-ops outside of Co-op Society? Probably. But entering uni as a co-op definitely made it easier, and frankly I need all the help I can get when it comes to socialising.

Part of me does wish that I dropped earlier and just went for a non-co-op internship in the summer between second and third year. But at the time I was very scared of having to return almost $40k (since I was dropping before my first placement). Also, how was I supposed to know how much I would dislike corporate life? Perhaps the co-op office are onto something when they tell us we won‚Äôt know we don‚Äôt like something until we try it.

### aight got it i‚Äôm not gonna waste my time applying to co-op

Wait wait wait that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying at all!

The co-op program is really beneficial for certain things, it‚Äôs just in my case the benefits didn‚Äôt align with my goals or needs.

Reasons why co-op is actually a really good idea:

- **Job security.** The difficulty of getting internships and a grad job, and the importance of previous work experience varies between industries. For example, engineering and finance are extremely competitive, so having internships lined up for you is a big advantage. On the other hand, software engineers are highly in demand in Australia so it‚Äôs not uncommon to find an internship without co-op. But in this economy, who knows how long we can count on that üíÄ
- **Cash.** Having a sizeable income stream as soon as you start uni does help out a lot, especially if you‚Äôre thinking about moving out or living in college. It also takes the pressure off having to work while you‚Äôre still settling into uni.
- **Quality of sponsors.** I personally wasn‚Äôt particularly excited by the sponsors for the computer science stream, but that is certainly not the case for every stream. If you have some exciting sponsors in your stream, especially if they‚Äôre highly competitive to get into, then co-op is extremely worth it.

At the end of the day, the co-op program is just one good way of meeting people who inspire you, and getting the experience to develop professionally.

To take inspiration from a certain well-known educator, we could use the analogy of climbing a mountain.

<img src="/assets/img/co-op/mountain-base-flag.png" alt="Looking up the mountain of career fulfilment" style="max-width: 400px" />

Suppose we are all climbing some mountain where the summit represents the coveted promise of ‚ú®career fulfilment‚ú®. The climb is rocky and uncertain, but the co-op program has built a set of stairs starting from the base. As a co-op scholar, you get led to the base of the steps, and you‚Äôre able to climb those stairs as far as you‚Äôd like. The stairs certainly don‚Äôt reach all the way to the summit, but it does take you a good distance upwards, and you‚Äôre well set up to then push on to the peak.

But it turns out the stairs are not roped off! Many non co-op students begin the climb from a random spot at the base. At some point they may also find the stairs, whether they‚Äôve been directed by a mentor they‚Äôve found or by a fellow student. There‚Äôs endless societies and programs at university that offer development and networking opportunities! And from then on their path really isn‚Äôt any different from a co-op scholar‚Äôs.

Of course, what may also happen is as you‚Äôre climbing up those stairs, you‚Äôve realised you‚Äôve been climbing the wrong mountain. If you‚Äôve gone really far up, it‚Äôs also a pretty far way back down. Nothing impossible, but just a bit annoying.

Moral of the story, your career journey will be winding and tough at times. It‚Äôs easy to both consciously and unconsciously feel pressure after seeing peers race ahead, but there‚Äôs no harm in taking your time and making sure you‚Äôre heading in the right direction for **_you_**. If being a co-op scholar will help you do that, then that‚Äôs awesome! And if not, the dropout life is pretty great too :D

### bonus: i want to drop out but i‚Äôm scared. how do i do it??

1. **Back yourself.** Whether they do it intentionally or not, the co-op office will always try to make it sound like getting industry opportunities outside of the program will be extremely difficult. It won‚Äôt be easy, but you were selected as a co-op scholar in the first place for a reason. You are more than capable of learning employable skills and finding the right opportunities for yourself.
2. **Expect to be quizzed about your reasons for leaving.** The co-op office just wants to understand why you are leaving so that they might make changes to encourage the remaining co-ops to stay. That does mean it will feel slightly like an interrogation but they‚Äôre (probably) not actually trying to change your mind or being salty.
3. **Don‚Äôt mention any other offers if you have any.** I realise I am encouraging lying by omission, which is potentially ethically wrong. BUT I‚Äôm just saying that all the people I know who had negative conversations with the co-op office did reveal that they were taking a different job opportunity. If you want to avoid that, stick to the other reasons why co-op is not going to work out for you. Here‚Äôs a list of ideas to get you started :)
   - I want to study a different degree
   - The sponsors don‚Äôt align with my interests
   - I want to prioritise other commitments over work

Best of luck soldier ü´°
