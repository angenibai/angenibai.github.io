- name: The Celiac Paradox
  id: celiac-paradox
  shortDescription: Research into the genetic evolution of celiac disease
  longDescription: >
    <p>A year-long independent research project for HSC Science Extension.</p>
    <p>Read the <a href="/other/celiac-paradox-report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>, and check out the <a href="https://github.com/angenibai/snp-population-frequencies" target="_blank">scripts</a> I used to process genetic data!</p>
    <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> When I found out that predisposition to celiac disease was genetic, I thought I could find some cool evidence of natural selection - where ethnic groups from societies that started growing gluten-containing cereals earliest in history would have lower frequency of the target genes. Turns out I was wrong! Instead, I found evidence of some other genetic factors at play.</p>
